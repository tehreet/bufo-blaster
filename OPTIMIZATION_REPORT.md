           this.pool = [];
           this.activeProjectiles = new Set();
           this.initializePool(initialSize);
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Spatial Partitioning for Collision Detection**
   ```javascript
   // For when enemy count gets very high (>100)
   class SpatialGrid {
       constructor(worldWidth, worldHeight, cellSize = 100) {
           this.cellSize = cellSize;
           this.grid = new Map();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Save System Implementation**
   ```javascript
   // Add player progression persistence
   class SaveSystem {
       static saveGame(playerData) {
           localStorage.setItem('bufoBlaster_save', JSON.stringify(playerData));
